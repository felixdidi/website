# website

This repo contains all publicly available, customized files from my website (like the stylesheet, template and java script functions). In this repo, I do not provide the fonts (which are referenced in my blog post) as well as the files and libraries which are automatically embedded while knitting the page.

The Rmd code for each page can be downloaded from the respective page via the sidebar.
