  abstract = {The rise of music streaming services such as Spotify has transformed music listening behavior. Most prominently, online recommender systems foster highly individualized exposure to content and substantially shape user experience (UX). Yet, no research so far has investigated whether good or bad UX in the context of algorithmically curated music listening may be attributed to the actual functions of the algorithm (i.e., prevalence of personalized suggestions), users’ perceptions of the algorithm (i.e., interface transparency; individual perception and general algorithmic awareness), or both. In the present study, we attempt to separate these components of algorithmic curation by exploring their differential effects on users’ experience of enjoyment and serendipity. We employed a linkage design within which we combined data collected through the experience sampling method with digital trace data about the listening behavior of participants collected through the Spotify API. We recruited 144 participants, resulting in T = 6,920 situational measurement occasions, of which 40\% (t = 2,786) were preceded by a Spotify listening session. We find that sessions characterized by more algorithmic curation were enjoyed less. This finding emerged both for the objectively measured prevalence of algorithmic curation (with and without interface cues signaling the presence of algorithmic curation) and for users’ subjective perception of algorithmic curation. Furthermore, sessions with a higher prevalence of algorithmic curation were perceived as more novel and unexpected. This novelty, however, was evaluated more positively only by users with a high awareness for automated decision-making in situations in which Spotify's interface provided them with cues about the algorithm's presence. These findings indicate that algorithmic recommendations may not always contribute to better UX but can be beneficial in specific use cases such as content discovery, yet only if users are aware that they are interacting with an algorithm and these interactions are in line with their goals.},

  abstract = {Based on the dual-process model of entertainment experiences and motivated cognition, we propose that specific affective states such as surprise, curiosity, and confusion (so-called epistemic emotions), as well as empathy, are involved in eudaimonic entertainment experiences while reading political news. We further assume that these emotions are related to normatively desirable outcomes such as deliberation within, information seeking, and knowledge acquisition about political topics. To test the hypothesized model, we conducted a between-subjects online experiment (N = 407) that used different stimuli to induce the emotions of interest while simultaneously varying news topics. Structural equation modeling revealed that the data mostly supported our hypotheses. Overall, we find that through these affective states, even soft news can enable normatively desirable outcomes.

  abstract = {The use of digital communication technologies such as social media, mobile phones, instant messaging, or games, has been found to differentially satisfy and frustrate users’ need for autonomy. Consequently, such technology use can have differential and divergent effects, for example on users’ well-being and mental health. Through our (computational) scoping review of a very broad literature base, we find that many different research perspectives are involved in the study of what constitutes need-based experiences of autonomy in digital technology use. To advance the application of self-determination theory in human–computer interaction, communication research, and beyond, we seek to explain the complex relationship of technology use and individuals’ autonomy need experiences by integrating insights from these diverse perspectives. Based on the heterogenous and often weak theoretical basis within the investigated literature, we suggest that future research should differentiate between control as the central technology-centered (i.e. material) component and authenticity as the core user-centered (i.e. experiential) component, which together constitute experiences of autonomy need satisfaction in digital technology use. Furthermore, it should consider relevant contextual and situational boundary conditions, which can be derived from the reviewed literature.},

  abstract = {In the current media environment, technology design and media content are optimized for entertainment and a frictionless user experience – at times at the cost of frustrating users who have problems to disengage from media use sessions. In order to improve the disengagement experience, it is of interest which aspects of technology design impact users’ termination of a media use session. A systematic review identified n = 27 publications that address k = 90 media cues to overview the literature and to theoretically systematise media cues for disengagement. Results show that the research field is still small yet investigating many idiosyncratic media cues for disengagement from a variety of media use types. A focus currently lies on Human-Computer Interaction approaches to online search and information as well as gaming. We systematise the identified media cues along the analysis levels of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Computer-Mediated Communication (device, application, feature, interaction, and message cues) to uncover patterns and gaps in the literature. Based on the findings, we formulate a research agenda for situational, theory-driven research on media cues and disengagement across different forms of media use.},

  abstract = {Consuming media entertainment often challenges recipients’ self-control. While past research related self-control almost exclusively to whether individuals engage in media use, it might be equally relevant for the disengagement from media use. Testing core assumptions of the Appraisal of Media Use, Self-Control, and Entertainment (AMUSE) model, the present study investigates the situational interplay of self-control and affective appraisals in predicting disengagement from Netflix use. Preregistered hypotheses were tested based on an event-contingent experience sampling design, in which 205 adult Netflix users in the Netherlands and Germany were tracked and surveyed for two weeks. Results demonstrate that disengagement is contingent upon enjoyment and appreciation and that enjoyment, in turn, can be “spoiled” by feeling guilty. Self-control influenced goal conflict and enjoyment throughout the reception process. We discuss opportunities for modeling disengagement from media use with situational research approaches.},

  abstract = {Media are frequently used for coping with everyday stressors, but little is known about what content individuals choose under such adversity. Building on mood management theory’s propositions about semantic affinity of content, we test how adversity in specific life domains is reflected in choice of entertaining media content surrounding the same life domain. In combining diary data from n\,=\,122 Netflix users and data donations of their viewing histories with n\,=\,2,122 titles, our study provides a novel methodological approach. Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that daily media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres. These results emphasize (a) a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding semantic affinity in real-life media use and (b) the importance of situational approaches in media coping research.},

  abstract = {The question of what is important when we evaluate movies is crucial for understanding how lay audiences experience and evaluate entertainment products such as films. In line with this, subjective movie evaluation criteria (SMEC) have been conceptualized as mental representations of important attitudes toward specific film features. Based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of self-report data from online surveys, previous research has found and validated eight dimensions. Given the large-scale evaluative information that is available in online users’ comments in movie databases, it seems likely that what online users write about movies may enrich our knowledge about SMEC. As a first fully exploratory attempt, drawing on an open-source dataset including movie reviews from IMDb, we estimated a correlated topic model to explore the underlying topics of those reviews. In 35,136 online movie reviews, the most prevalent topics tapped into three major categories—Hedonism, Actors’ Performance, and Narrative—and indicated what reviewers mostly wrote about. Although a qualitative analysis of the reviews revealed that users mention certain SMEC, results of the topic model covered only two SMEC: Story Innovation and Light-heartedness. Implications for SMEC and entertainment research are discussed.},
