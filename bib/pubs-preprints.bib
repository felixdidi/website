  abstract = {Experimental evidence has profoundly contributed to our understanding of Mood Management Theory (MMT) in the context of music. Extant research, however, lacks insights into everyday mood regulation through music listening, especially on music streaming services where selections can be guided by algorithmic recommendations. Hence, we tested MMT in a naturalistic setting by combining experience sampling with logged music streaming data, while accounting for algorithmic curation as a boundary condition to users’ music choices. In a pre-registered study using T = 6,918 observations from N = 144 listeners, results showed that mood, music selection, and algorithmic curation varied substantially from situation to situation. However, we found no effects between mood and music choices that would confirm MMT’s selection hypotheses, yet small mood-congruent music effects on mood. Algorithmic curation did not establish novel MMT-related choice patterns. Our findings suggest re-specifying MMT and related media use theories for daily life.},

  abstract = {Media are frequently used for coping with everyday stressors, but little is known about what content individuals choose under such adversity. Building on mood management theory’s propositions about semantic affinity of content, we test how adversity in specific life domains is reflected in choice of entertaining media content surrounding the same life domain. In combining diary data from n = 122 Netflix users and data donations of their viewing histories with n = 2,122 titles, our study provides a novel methodological approach. Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that situational media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres. These results emphasize (a) a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding semantic affinity in real-life media use, and (b) the importance of situational approaches in media coping research.},
