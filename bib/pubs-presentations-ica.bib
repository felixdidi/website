  abstract = {Previous research suggests that while many smartphone users experience social pressure to be available, only some of them perceive this as a burden. This two-study investigation examines the underlying processes through which this form of social pressure influences well-being and perceived stress. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of the intrinsic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness during mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and competence, but that it was not linked with relatedness. Study 2 applied a repeated-measures design to verify these findings. It further examined the role of media-related goal conflicts. Results suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which, in turn, is associated with reduced competence need satisfaction. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure on self-control and intrinsic need satisfaction during mobile communication.},

This extensive advertising strategy has led to an increase in votes for populist parties/politicians and in membership numbers for extremist groups. Although there are speculations in media reports that the simple worldview created by populists contributes to more extreme positions, no study tested whether extremists rely on populist communication in their communiqués. The current study therefore investigated whether populist communication styles are present in extremist propaganda. A quantitative content analysis on N=51 extremist YouTube videos (n=25 right-wing extremist,n=26 Islamist extremist) was conducted to analyze potential differences between ideologies. The results demonstrate that 30\% of videos display all three elements of populism (people centrism, anti-elitism and restoration of sovereignty). However, multilevel analysis revealed only small differences between ideologies regarding the use of populist communication. The discussion will focus on implications of populist communication in extremist videos and potential prevention strategies.},
