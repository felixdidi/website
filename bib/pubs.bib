  abstract = {Based on the dual-process model of entertainment experiences and motivated cognition, we propose that specific affective states such as surprise, curiosity, and confusion (so-called epistemic emotions), as well as empathy, are involved in eudaimonic entertainment experiences while reading political news. We further assume that these emotions are related to normatively desirable outcomes such as deliberation within, information seeking, and knowledge acquisition about political topics. To test the hypothesized model, we conducted a between-subjects online experiment (N = 407) that used different stimuli to induce the emotions of interest while simultaneously varying news topics. Structural equation modeling revealed that the data mostly supported our hypotheses. Overall, we find that through these affective states, even soft news can enable normatively desirable outcomes.

  abstract = {The use of digital communication technologies such as social media, mobile phones, instant messaging, or games, has been found to differentially satisfy and frustrate users’ need for autonomy. Consequently, such technology use can have differential and divergent effects, for example on users’ well-being and mental health. Through our (computational) scoping review of a very broad literature base, we find that many different research perspectives are involved in the study of what constitutes need-based experiences of autonomy in digital technology use. To advance the application of self-determination theory in human–computer interaction, communication research, and beyond, we seek to explain the complex relationship of technology use and individuals’ autonomy need experiences by integrating insights from these diverse perspectives. Based on the heterogenous and often weak theoretical basis within the investigated literature, we suggest that future research should differentiate between control as the central technology-centered (i.e. material) component and authenticity as the core user-centered (i.e. experiential) component, which together constitute experiences of autonomy need satisfaction in digital technology use. Furthermore, it should consider relevant contextual and situational boundary conditions, which can be derived from the reviewed literature.},

Extant research, however, lacks insights into everyday mood regulation through music listening, especially on music streaming services where selections can be guided by algorithmic recommendations. Hence, we tested MMT in a naturalistic setting by combining experience sampling with logged music streaming data, while accounting for algorithmic curation as a boundary condition to users’ music choices. In a pre-registered study using T = 6,918 observations from N = 144 listeners, results showed that mood, music selection, and algorithmic curation varied substantially from situation to situation. However, we found no effects between mood and music choices that would confirm MMT’s selection hypotheses, yet small mood-congruent music effects on mood. Algorithmic curation did not establish novel MMT-related choice patterns. Our findings suggest re-specifying MMT and related media use theories for daily life.},

While past research related self-control almost exclusively to whether individuals engage in media use, it might be equally relevant for the disengagement from media use. Testing core assumptions of the Appraisal of Media Use, Self-Control, and Entertainment (AMUSE) model, the present study investigates the situational interplay of self-control and affective appraisals in predicting disengagement from Netflix use. Preregistered hypotheses were tested based on an event-contingent experience sampling design, in which 205 adult Netflix users in the Netherlands and Germany were tracked and surveyed for two weeks. Results demonstrate that disengagement is contingent upon enjoyment and appreciation and that enjoyment, in turn, can be “spoiled” by feeling guilty. Self-control influenced goal conflict and enjoyment throughout the reception process. We discuss opportunities for modeling disengagement from media use with situational research approaches.},

Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and competence, but that it was not linked with relatedness. Study 2 applied a repeated-measures design to verify these findings. It further examined the role of media-related goal conflicts. Results suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which, in turn, is associated with reduced competence need satisfaction.

In combining diary data from n\,=\,122 Netflix users and data donations of their viewing histories with n\,=\,2,122 titles, our study provides a novel methodological approach. Our findings show no effects of daily adversity on selecting content with more or less semantic affinity, but exploratory analyses reveal that daily media coping strategies differentially relate to the selection of different entertainment genres. These results emphasize (a) a lack of conceptual clarity surrounding semantic affinity in real-life media use and (b) the importance of situational approaches in media coping research.},

The current study therefore investigated whether populist communication styles are present in extremist propaganda. A quantitative content analysis on N=51 extremist YouTube videos (n=25 right-wing extremist,n=26 Islamist extremist) was conducted to analyze potential differences between ideologies. The results demonstrate that 30\% of videos display all three elements of populism (people centrism, anti-elitism and restoration of sovereignty). However, multilevel analysis revealed only small differences between ideologies regarding the use of populist communication. The discussion will focus on implications of populist communication in extremist videos and potential prevention strategies.},

In line with this, subjective movie evaluation criteria (SMEC) have been conceptualized as mental representations of important attitudes toward specific film features. Based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of self-report data from online surveys, previous research has found and validated eight dimensions. Given the large-scale evaluative information that is available in online users’ comments in movie databases, it seems likely that what online users write about movies may enrich our knowledge about SMEC. As a first fully exploratory attempt, drawing on an open-source dataset including movie reviews from IMDb, we estimated a correlated topic model to explore the underlying topics of those reviews. In 35,136 online movie reviews, the most prevalent topics tapped into three major categories—Hedonism, Actors’ Performance, and Narrative—and indicated what reviewers mostly wrote about. Although a qualitative analysis of the reviews revealed that users mention certain SMEC, results of the topic model covered only two SMEC: Story Innovation and Light-heartedness. Implications for SMEC and entertainment research are discussed.},
