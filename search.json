We further assume that these emotions are related to normatively desirable outcomes such as deliberation within, information seeking, and knowledge acquisition about political topics. To test the hypothesized model, we conducted a between-subjects online experiment (N = 407) that used different stimuli to induce the emotions of interest while simultaneously varying news topics. Structural equation modeling revealed that the data mostly supported our hypotheses. Overall, we find that through these affective states, even soft news can enable normatively desirable outcomes.

In line with this, subjective movie evaluation criteria (SMEC) have been conceptualized as mental representations of important attitudes toward specific film features. Based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of self-report data from online surveys, previous research has found and validated eight dimensions. Given the large-scale evaluative information that is available in online users’ comments in movie databases, it seems likely that what online users write about movies may enrich our knowledge about SMEC. As a first fully exploratory attempt, drawing on an open-source dataset including movie reviews from IMDb, we estimated a correlated topic model to explore the underlying topics of those reviews. In 35,136 online movie reviews, the most prevalent topics tapped into three major categories—Hedonism, Actors’ Performance, and Narrative—and indicated what reviewers mostly wrote about. Although a qualitative analysis of the reviews revealed that users mention certain SMEC, results of the topic model covered only two SMEC: Story Innovation and Light-heartedness. Implications for SMEC and entertainment research are discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSchneider, F. M., Domahidi, E., & Dietrich, F. (2020). What is important when we evaluate movies?

Consequently, such technology use can have differential and divergent effects, for example on users’ well-being and mental health. Through our (computational) scoping review of a very broad literature base, we find that many different research perspectives are involved in the study of what constitutes need-based experiences of autonomy in digital technology use. To advance the application of self-determination theory in human–computer interaction, communication research, and beyond, we seek to explain the complex relationship of technology use and individuals’ autonomy need experiences by integrating insights from these diverse perspectives. Based on the heterogenous and often weak theoretical basis within the investigated literature, we suggest that future research should differentiate between control as the central technology-centered (i.e. material) component and authenticity as the core user-centered (i.e. experiential) component, which together constitute experiences of autonomy need satisfaction in digital technology use. Furthermore, it should consider relevant contextual and situational boundary conditions, which can be derived from the reviewed literature.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDietrich, F., Arenz, A., & Reinecke, L.

While past research related self-control almost exclusively to whether individuals engage in media use, it might be equally relevant for the disengagement from media use. Testing core assumptions of the Appraisal of Media Use, Self-Control, and Entertainment (AMUSE) model, the present study investigates the situational interplay of self-control and affective appraisals in predicting disengagement from Netflix use. Preregistered hypotheses were tested based on an event-contingent experience sampling design, in which 205 adult Netflix users in the Netherlands and Germany were tracked and surveyed for two weeks. Results demonstrate that disengagement is contingent upon enjoyment and appreciation and that enjoyment, in turn, can be “spoiled” by feeling guilty. Self-control influenced goal conflict and enjoyment throughout the reception process. We discuss opportunities for modeling disengagement from media use with situational research approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGilbert, A., Reinecke, L., Meier, A., Baumgartner, S.
