I teach classes at the [Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz](https://uni-mainz.de). In the past, I have also taught classes at the [University of Mannheim](https://uni-mannheim.de). In the interest of keeping my teaching materials accessible, the respective course websites are publicly available for modules with a yellow frame. More materials are hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/felixdidi) Page or on the [JGU's Moodle Platform](https://lms.uni-mainz.de).
